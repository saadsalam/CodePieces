My name is Eric, and I want to reach out and introduce myself. I will be your new primary point of contact for our partnership.
I see that today you use PC*MILER for mileages in your AutoLynx TMS.
Do you have 15 minutes to touch base briefly on a call this week or next? It would be great to connect and learn how I can better assist you.
I am looking forward to working with you.
 
Thank you,
Eric
