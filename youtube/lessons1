 I started this year since june and so far I made about 20K but had to work pretty hard for it. 
 Rule 1: never pick up a half done website.
 Rule 2: never take a job where they want to "do things themselves".
 And don't work with fixed prices if you calculate your price on a best case scenario.
 Rule 3: don't do content manangement 
 Rule 4: don't promise a sales target on their website.
Rule 5: start sending invoices every money and not just at the end of the project.
Rule 5: Put every website on your own webserver and don't release it untill it's paid.
Rule 6: Don't work for free. 
Rule 7: Don't work for free.
