6-Issue in deployment:
The definition of this report is not valid or supported by this version of Reporting Services.
The report definition may have been created with a later version of Reporting Services,
or contain content that is not well-formed or not valid based on Reporting Services schemas. Details: The report definition has an invalid target namespace 'http://schemas.microsoft.com/sqlserver/reporting/2016/01/reportdefinition' which cannot be upgraded. (rsInvalidReportDefinition)

Ans: If you have the solution > properties > TargetServerVersion set to SQL Server 2008 R2, 2012 or 2014 and then 
upload the RDL from the bin folder instead of the project folder, it should work. I was getting the same error and that solved it.
