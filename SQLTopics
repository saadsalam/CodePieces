What are main differences between wildcards and regular expressions?
---------------------------------------------------------------
A regular expression is a pattern used to match text.
A wildcard is a component you can use within a regular expression that indicates you 
are trying to match a more broadly-defined pattern than a specific set of characters. 

The PATINDEX() function returns the position of the first occurrence of a pattern in a string. 
The syntax of the PATINDEX() function is as follows:

PATINDEX ( '%pattern%' , input_string )

PAtindex
--------------
Return the position of a pattern in a string:

SELECT PATINDEX('%schools%', 'W3Schools.com');
Result: 3

Select Top 20 * from VehicleDamageDetail VDD
WHERE
PATINDEX('%[[0-9][[0-9][[0-9][[0-9][[0-9]%',VDD.DamageCode) > 0
			  


Stuff
------
The STUFF() function deletes a part of a string and then inserts another part into the string, starting at a specified position.

SELECT STUFF('SQL Tutorial', 1, 3, 'HTML');

Reult:HTML Tutorial

UTC:
 Select Top 20  ShipToEarlyArrival,
 STUFF(CONVERT(VARCHAR(50), (DATEADD(ss,-1 *DATEDIFF(ss,GETUTCDATE(),GETDATE()),ShipToEarlyArrival)), 127), 19, 4, '') + 'Z' AS 
 ShipToEarlyArrival

Result:

2019-06-08 00:45:37.147		2019-06-08T04:45:37Z
2019-06-08 00:45:37.147		2019-06-08T04:45:37Z


Len and DataLength:
----------------
leading spaces: Spaces in the begining.
trailing blanks : Spaces at the end.
One difference between the LEN() and DATALENGTH() functions is that the LEN() function excludes trailing blanks
(trailing spaces, tabs, etc) whereas DATALENGTH() includes trailing blanks. 
Note, we’re only talking about blanks that come at the end of the string – not at the start or in the middle.

SELECT  LEN('Lit ') AS Len,    DATALENGTH('Lit ') AS DataLength;
Result:
Len  DataLength
---  ----------
3    4
